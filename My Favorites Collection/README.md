# My Favorites Collection: Movie List App

## Project Description
This iOS application displays a collection of favorite movies using a UITableView. Including working with table views, custom cells, and simple user interactions.

## Chosen Theme: Favorite Movies
For this project, I chose to implement a list of favorite movies. Each entry in the list displays:
- Movie poster
- Movie title
- Release year
- Genre

This theme allows for visually appealing content with the movie posters while also providing key information about each film.
