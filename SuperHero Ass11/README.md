# Random Superhero Roller App

## Project Description
This iOS application, Random Superhero Roller, allows users to roll a random superhero and display their image, stats, and biography. Built using UIKit, the app integrates the Superhero API to fetch and display dynamic superhero data. The project highlights key iOS development skills, including UI customization, API integration with Alamofire, and image handling with Kingfisher.
## Chosen Theme: Superhero Randomizer  
For this project, I chose to implement a fun superhero randomizer. Each roll fetches a new superhero with the following information:
- Hero image
- Hero name
- Power stats (Intelligence, Strength, Speed, etc.)
- Biography (Full Name, Alter Egos, etc.)

This theme is engaging and provides a great way to showcase visually appealing content and interactive user experiences.
